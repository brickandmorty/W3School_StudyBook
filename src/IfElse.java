        /* Short Hand If...Else
        There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator
        because it consists of three operands.
        It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line,
        and is most often used to replace simple if else statements:

        Syntax

        variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue :  expressionFalse;

        eg. int time = 20;
        String result = (time < 18) ? "Guten Tag!" : "Guten Abend.";

        System.out.println(result);

         */
    }
}
